\title{Calculate island area over time}
\usage{
pleistoshape_area(points, epsg, intervalfile, mapdir, outdir)
}
\arguments{
\item{points}{A user-generated multi-point shapefile (.shp) containing at least two points. If the shapefile attribute table contains a column
labelled 'Name', the output distance matrix will use the identifiers in this column to label each pairwise comparison. Otherwise, the
output distance matrix will use the attribute FID values instead.}

\item{epsg}{The projected coordinate system in EPSG code format. Because of the curvature of the Earth's surface, we need to apply a map
projection to accurately calculate straight-line distances between points instead of using the default WGS84 geographical coordinate system.
Users should specify a projected coordinate system appropriate to the geographic region being analysed using the projection's
associated EPSG code (https://epsg.org/home). Geographic coordinate system projections are not recommended as those will result
in distance matrices calculated in decimal degrees rather than in distance units.}

\item{intervalfile}{This is the master control file generated using either the getintervals_time() or getintervals_sealvl()
function that defines the number of intervals, the sea level at each interval, and the duration of each interval. By default, this
function will use the "intervals.csv" file stored in the output folder, but users can also specify their own custom interval
file (with nice round mean sea level values, for example), although users need to ensure that the same column names are preserved, and
be aware that custom interval files may lead to inaccurate weighted mean calculations.}

\item{mapdir}{The directory containing map outputs from the makemaps() function
(i.e. the directory containing the raster_flat, raster_topo, and shapefile folders).}

\item{outdir}{Output directory for the 2D island area matrix file.
If the specified output directory doesn't already exist, PleistoDist will create the output directory.}
}
\value{
This function outputs a matrix of 2D island area estimates in long format, with one column per interval.
}
\description{
This function calculates the 2-dimensional area of user-specified islands at each time/sea level interval, and calculates the weighted average area over the user-defined time period.
PleistoDist will return a value of NA if the island is submerged underwater for that particular interval.
