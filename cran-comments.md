## R CMD check results

* There were no ERRORs or NOTEs, but there was a WARNING "No examples, no tests, no vignettes". As this package is a geospatial package that relies on shapefile inputs, there are no examples in the documentation since the .dbf extension of shapefiles will trigger an error. Instead, vignettes for this package are available at [](https://davidbirdtan.com/pleistodist/).
